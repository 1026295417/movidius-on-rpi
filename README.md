# movidius-on-rpi

All about using Movidius neural compute sticks on the Raspberry Pi

This repo is the ongoing result of a series Meetups I have been hosting for Chicago Area Embedded Deep Learning:
https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Area-Embedded-Deep-Learning

**As of 12/19/17 Movidius is saying you can have the NCS or TensorFlow, but not both:**
* [Build directions for a microSD card image for a Raspberry Pi with a Movidius Neural Compute Stick(NCS).](build.md)
* [Build directions for a microSD card image with Raspberry Pi with Tensorflow](tensorflow_build.md)

**Slides from a very short demo I gave:**
* [Movidius NCS on RPi Demo.pdf](movidius_ncs_on_rpi_demo.pdf)
* [Movidius NCS on RPi Demo.pptx](movidius_ncs_on_rpi_demo.pptx)

**FAQ:**
**What are the Movidius links?:**
* https://ncsforum.movidius.com/
* https://github.com/movidius/ncappzoo
* https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk

**What hardwhere do I need to get into this?**
* Really you need a ubuntu 14.04 PC, RPi, and NCS.

**More FAQ's to Come
