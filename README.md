# movidius-on-rpi

This repo is all about using Movidius neural compute stick on the Raspberry Pi


**As of 12/19/17 Movidius is saying you can have the NCS or TensorFlow, but not both:**
* [Build directions for a microSD card image for a Raspberry Pi with a Movidius Neural Compute Stick(NCS).](build.md)
* [Build directions for a microSD card image with Raspberry Pi with Tensorflow](tensorflow_build.md)


**Slides from a short demo I gave:**
* [Movidius NCS on RPi Demo.pdf](Movidius NCS on RPi Demo.pdf)
* [Movidius NCS on RPi Demo.pptx](Movidius NCS on RPi Demo.pptx)
